# WWW:TMDB::API  0.5.0

## Summary

Implements the API for The Movie Database (TMDB) (http://api.themoviedb.org)

## Description

Lightweight package to retrieve movie/tv programme data from The Movie Database (http://www.themoviedb.org/ ) using their API (v3).

This project is a fork of the CPAN module WWW::TMDB::API written by Maria Celina Baratang 2012-03-14. Unfortunately that package has not been updated since 2012, since when several 'breaking' changes from TMDB have, umm, broken it.

Alternative packages are feature-rich and therefore more code-heavy. Therefore I decided to update the 2012 package to make it work in 2022, adding a few recent features along the way, while keeping its lightweight nature.

The package is not meant to provide all the functionality of the TMDB API: its purpose is to perform basic searching of movies and tv programmes, and allow you to retrieve programme metadata including cast, crew, and keywords data.
